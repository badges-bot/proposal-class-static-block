    <p>A class static block Environment Record is a declarative Environement Record that is used to represent the top-level scope of a class static block and provides a `this` binding.</p>
    <p>Class Static Block Environment Records have the additional state fields listed in <emu-xref href="#table-class-static-block"></emu-xref>.</p>
